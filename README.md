# ResNet-networks
This is the architecture of ResNet networks.
- The ResNet type of CNN was designed by `Microsoft Research` to compete in the international `ILSVRC` competition.
- The ResNet in the 2015 contest took first place in all categories for the ImageNet and Common Objects in Context `COCO`.
- The researchers for the residual block design pattern component of the residual network proposed a new novel layer connection they called and `identity link`.

# Architecure
- ResNet34 introduced a new block layer and layer-connection pattern, residual blocks, and identity connection respectively.
- The `residual block` in ResNet34 consists of blocks of two identical convolutional layers without a pooling layer. Each block has an `identity connection` that creates a parallel path between the input of the residual block and its output.
